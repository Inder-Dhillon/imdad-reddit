### Prologue:
The developer of Dad Bot is not responsible for anything the account u/imdad_bot says, it is just quoting other people.

### Description:
Uses Reddit API using the wrapper library praw to make Hi ______ I'm Dad Jokes on [_u/imdad_bot_](https://www.reddit.com/user/imdad_bot/?sort=top).

##### Example:
![example](https://github.com/Inder-Dhillon/imdad-reddit/raw/master/examples/ex1.PNG)

### Overview:
The program monitors r/all commment section to see if anyone has commented using _I'm_ and then replies with a _Hi I'm Dad Joke_ with the substring that follows _I'm_ using Reddit's API wrapper library praw. No easy buckets.

##### Modules used:
praw : Wrapper library for Reddit's API

### Epilogue:
The bot makes about 1000 comments/hr which will likely be the reason it'll get _banned_ soon.
Heres a visualization:

I could rate limit it but people like it so **I'll let it go crazy**.
Now if someone in the future (_Hi future human, I'm Dad._) sees this and the account is dead you know what happened.
